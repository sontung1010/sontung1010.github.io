![profile](/images/about.JPG)

I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My study field specializes in Robotics.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electromechanical Systems Engineering Technology from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant with [ROAHM Lab](https://www.roahmlab.com/) and [UM Field Robotics Group](https://fieldrobotics.engin.umich.edu/). My primary research area is Autonomous Vehicles. 

However, my interest also spreads across Bionic Robotics Arm, Quadruped Robots, Hexapod Robots, Bipedal Robots, AI/ML, Computer Visions, Embedded Software, and Mechanical Design. My passion and goal are building fully functioning and even transforming robots.
