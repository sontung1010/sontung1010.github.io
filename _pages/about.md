![hexapod](images/hexapod.png)

I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My study field specializes in Robotics.

Before embarking on my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electromechanical Systems Engineering Technology from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, where I graduated as a Valedictorian of my class with honors. 

Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant with [ROAHM Lab](https://www.roahmlab.com/) and [UM Field Robotics Group](https://fieldrobotics.engin.umich.edu/). My primary research area is Autonomous Vehicles. 

However, my interest also spreads across Bionic Robotics Arm, Quadruped Robots, Hexapod Robots, AI/ML, Computer Visions, Embedded Software, and Mechanical Design. 

For work or professional inquiries, I can be reached at my email address or through my LinkedIn profile.
