![profile](/images/about2.jpg)

I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My study field specializes in Robotics.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electromechanical Systems Engineering Technology from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant with [ROAHM Lab](https://www.roahmlab.com/) and [UM Field Robotics Group](https://fieldrobotics.engin.umich.edu/). My research interest is applying Multimodal Reinforcement Learning and Control Theory to make Robots adapt to different environments and tasks.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and games.
