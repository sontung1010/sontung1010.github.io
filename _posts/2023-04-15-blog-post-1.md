It has been an incredible journey with day and night hard work with the up-and-down application process. Thanks to the MIT EECS Graduate Application Assistance Program for helping me with my material. Thanks to Professor Scott Boskovich, Professor Farhana Abedin, and Professor Farbod Khoshnoud in the Electromechanical Engineering Department at Cal Poly Pomona for their great letters of recommendation. Lastly, I want to thank my family and close friends who have supported and helped me on my journey.
