Migrated the legacy code of ROS Python from the Jetson TX2 board to the Jetson AGX Orin board. Then, I optimized and modified the legacy code to be compatible with the new version of PyTorch, TensorFlow, CUDA, CUDNN, and NumPy. 
Optimizing the board’s performance with UNet deep learning architecture to increase the semantic segmentation’s efficiency.
Implement the algorithm from the simulation into real-world behavior of multi-agent experiments for both rovers. 
Built and programmed embedded control on STM32 VESC and Jetson TX2’s Linux environment for a second autonomous rover.
