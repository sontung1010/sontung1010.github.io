        <b>Brief:</b> Here is our recent progress with the Clearpath Heron autonomous surface vessel (ASV). Our latest tests in the wave tank were focused on pushing the boundaries of what's possible for autonomous controls, planning, and navigation amidst realistic wave conditions. These insights are crucial as we strive to enhance ASV autonomy for navigating through challenging environments. This cutting-edge project is propelled forward with the support of a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship.

        <b>Contribution:</b><br>
        - Programmed the Unmanned Surface Vehicle’s (USV) Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) model and the University of Michigan’s Marine Hydrodynamics Lab “world” model to establish the simulation environment using ROS2 and Gazebo Garden. This setup facilitated the testing of autonomous functions and the conduct of deep-learning research.<br>
        - Developed an object avoidance algorithm using Python and C++ to assess the experiment's performance in both real-world and simulated environment.<br>
        - Conducted real-world tests to collect LIDAR, odometry, drive, velocity, and IMU data, which was then replicated in the simulation environment. Currently, efforts are focused on analyzing and post-processing the data using Python.<br>
