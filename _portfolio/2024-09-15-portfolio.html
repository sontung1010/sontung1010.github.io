        <b>Brief:</b> While reinforcement learning offers potential for continual learning and adaptability in complex scenarios, its application to real-world robotics faces significant challenges. Unlike in simulations, physical platforms struggle to collect a diverse corpus of training data due to critical safety risks and the inherent constraints of operating within a dynamic and partially observable environment. Our work draws inspiration from the human capability to fuse and exploit multiple sensing modalities, construct comprehensive models of how the world operates, and then leverage those models to adeptly navigate in challenging and often unpredictable environments. Here is an overview of how unmanned vehicles (ground, air, and surface) can exploit a world model constructed through multimodal perception, to learn near-optimal policies for guidance and control. A key aspect of the approach is learning from imagination in which the world model is used to simulate future imagined trajectories, enabling it to anticipate potential risks before encountering them in the real world. Our ongoing work and long-term vision is to evolve the traditional sense-plan-act framework into a more intuitive and cognitively inspired sense-imagine-act model. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Orte6Uv_mGU&t=987s" target="_blank">Dr. Elena Shrestha's presentation of our research.</a>

        - Model uncertainty (dynamics)<br>
        - Reduced performance and reliability<br>
        - Real-time decision-making is essential<br>
        - The limitations of onboard hardware<br>
        - Complex, unstructured environments<br>
        - Stochastic nature of environment<br>
        - Localization and mapping<br>

        <b>Why Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL)?</b><br>
        - Better Adaptation: Learns an internal model of the environment, helping it adapt to new policies and conditions, unlike model-free RL, which relies only on previous experience.<br>
        - Faster Learning: Learns efficiently with fewer interactions than model-free RL, saving time and reducing the need for costly or risky data collection.<br>
        - Clearer Decisions: Tracks important details about the environment, making it easier to understand and improve the agent’s behavior.<br>
        - Stronger Sensor Integration: Combines inputs from multiple sensors (like LiDAR and cameras), giving a more accurate view of surroundings.<br>
        - Safer High-Speed Control: Plans actions with an awareness of dynamics, balancing speed with safety, ideal for real-time sudden scenarios.<br>
