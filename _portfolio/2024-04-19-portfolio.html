        <b>Brief:</b> This research addresses the challenge of shadow interference in Vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which is critical for applications in robotics and augmented reality. Traditional SLAM systems can be hindered by shadows in visual data, leading to inaccuracies in map construction and object localization. This paper proposes an innovative approach to detect and remove shadows from real-time video feeds, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of SLAM systems.

    - Applied the SpA-Former algorithm to the KITTI and FinnForest datasets, evaluating its effectiveness in comparison to traditional shadow removal methods in dynamic, variable lighting environments. This analysis was aimed at improving the reliability of vision-based systems in real-world robotics applications.<br>
    - Integrated and tested advanced machine learning techniques within vision-based SLAM systems, demonstrating how shadow removal algorithms can enhance object detection, environment mapping, and overall system accuracy in robotics and autonomous navigation. The focus was on improving the robustness of perception systems, crucial for real-time decision-making in robotics.<br>
