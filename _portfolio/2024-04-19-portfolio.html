        <b>Brief:</b> This research addresses the challenge of shadow interference in Vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), which is critical for applications in robotics and augmented reality. Traditional SLAM systems can be hindered by shadows in visual data, leading to inaccuracies in map construction and object localization. This paper proposes an innovative approach to detect and remove shadows from real-time video feeds, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of SLAM systems.
