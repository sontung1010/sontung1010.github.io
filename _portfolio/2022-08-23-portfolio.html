Developed Python scripts on Jetson Nanoâ€™s Linux environment and uploaded the mission to the Pixhawk. Launched autonomous flights, keeping the UAV in the air at 200 feet from the ground for 20-minute flights.
Programmed STM32 microcontroller using Embedded C and controlled it using the Raspberry Pi through serial communication. Integrated ROS Python to communicate between two Raspberry Pi to control the UGV wirelessly in a range of 700ft.
Successfully demo both UAV and UGV to Northrop Grumman.
