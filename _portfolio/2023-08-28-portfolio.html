Develop embedded C code, block diagram, and S-function to implement Adaptive Cruise Control and manual control on the NXP S32 board, which controls car simulation in Simulink from a haptic wheel attached to an encoder DC motor. The car simulation is connected to other car simulations through the CAN network and mutually transmits each otherâ€™s position to show on the screen.
