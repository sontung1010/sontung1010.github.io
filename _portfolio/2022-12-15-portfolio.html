        <b>Brief:</b> This is the project where we had to build a 1ft x 1ft robot that had to compete with others robot in 5 competitions: tug-of-war, ramp race, fox hunt, follow the lead, and log push.<br>

        I designed the front bumper with the highest possibility for aerodynamics but still be able to keep the log in contact under a considerable velocity.

    Ramp race rule: Have to go up a ram in your own zone, without interfering with other robot's path. This competition needs to be accurate and steady with velocity control.<br>

    Fox hunt rule: Each robot will be the hound once while the others will be the fox. If your team is the hound, the more robots you find the higher score you get. If a fox is found (come close within 2ft range of the hound), it is out. The foxes can choose to stay put, or keep moving, or flexible hiding, as long as it never gets into within 2ft range of the hound. The zone is 30ft x 30ft.<br>

    Follow the lead rule: Competition is in pairs randomly chosen, one robot will be the leader and the other is the follower. In a specific zone, the leader has to do everything to cut its tail wihin 1 minute, and end up or go pass the target corner. If the follower can follow no matter where the leader goes, the follower wins, else the leader wins. However, if the leader does not go the target zone within 1 minute, it also loses.

    Log push rule: The robot must be able to push a log continuously without failing or it will be out. We measures the distance that each robot pushes its log until the log is no longer in contact with the robot. Whichever robot with the maximum distance or crossed the finish line is considered win.<br>
