        <b>Brief:</b> During my internship at PACCAR Inc, I designed, prototyped, and tested automation components, including a tool changer for robotics and a self-aligning mechanism for automated system connections. I also worked on embedded programming and control system integration to automate key processes. This project involved collaboration with my team to ensure design feasibility and optimize system performance.<br>
