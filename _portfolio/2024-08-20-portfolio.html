        <b>Brief:</b> During my internship at PACCAR Inc, I designed, prototyped, and tested automation components, including a tool changer for robotics and a self-aligning mechanism for automated system connections. I also worked on embedded programming and control system integration to automate key processes. This project involved collaboration with my team to ensure design feasibility and optimize system performance.<br>

        <b>Contribution:</b><br>
        - Designed, prototyped, and tested a fully functional robotic tool changer and self-aligning docking mechanism for an automatic trailer hookup system, completing this unique proof-of-concept project within 3 months.<br>
        - Developed a self-calibrating suspension system for automatic alignment, achieving 90% docking accuracy in dynamic industrial environments using only simple pneumatic actuators.<br>
        - Conducted in-house 3D printing to fabricate the toolâ€™s components, reduced project costs by approximately $5,000 by avoiding buying the pre-built tool, and demonstrated the feasibility of cost-effective custom solutions.<br>
        - Collaborated with senior engineers to refine designs, select industry-grade parts and electronics, and integrate embedded control systems, significantly improving system efficiency and reliability.<br>
        - Enhanced driver safety and operational efficiency by automating manual processes and addressing critical challenges in human-machine interaction and safety-critical systems.<br>
