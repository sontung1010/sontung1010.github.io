        <b>Brief:</b> During my internship at PACCAR Inc, I designed, prototyped, and tested automation components, including a tool changer for robotics and a self-aligning mechanism for automated system connections. I also worked on embedded programming and control system integration to automate key processes. This project involved collaboration with my team to ensure design feasibility and optimize system performance.<br>

        <b>Contribution:</b><br>
        - Led independent research and development to design, prototype, and test a fully functional robotic tool changer, contributing to advancements in industrial robotics with novel mechanisms for seamless operation and reliability.<br>
        - Designed and prototyped a self-aligning mechanism for automatic docking in dynamic industrial environments, achieving precise alignment and operational robustness to improve robotic system autonomy.<br>
        - Completed the proof-of-concept entirely with in-house 3D printing, saving approximately $5,000 by avoiding off-the-shelf solutions and demonstrating effective cost-saving measures.<br>
        - Collaborated with senior engineers to refine technical designs, evaluate industry-grade components, and develop embedded control systems that automated critical processes, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and precision.<br>
